# Stock Vision Pro

Stock Vision Pro is a RAG application for acquiring real-time stock insights with the help of Google's Gemini-Pro LLM. Try the application here: https://muhammadqasimjamil.pythonanywhere.com/

The application asks the user for a stock symbol, it then acquires real-time market data from the stock symbol and then feeds it to Gemini-Pro in order to get insights about that stock. Furthermore, we utilized Vectara's HHEM library in order to try a lot of different combinations of prompts and LLMs in order to find the best combination possible for our application.

This application was developed in a team for the Unhallucinate 24-hour Challenge from lablab.ai
